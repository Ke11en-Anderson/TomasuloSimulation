# Read in relevant data from the text file and use the data to populate variables, lists, etc to be used in the simulation


# Create a class which is something like 'InstructionRecord' with all of the relevant members such as opcode, source_reg, etc. and a basic constructor


# Make the logic for the simulation
# Initialize each instruction record and put them in the queue
# Initialize all containers that we need such as reservation stations and execution units (probably can just be lists)
# Then issue, dispatch, broadcast etc.
# Make sure we are keeping track of all the data we need for the output file


# Create output file assuming we have all the data we need
